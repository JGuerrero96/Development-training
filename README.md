# Development-training
Apps made for training

This is an app I created for training purposes with Express.js, MongoDB, JSon, router.js, ejs and bootstrap 4. The purpose of the app is to
display a certain amount of video game maps added by users, in which they can add, modify and/or delete the information within as well as the
whole post itself.

This app will work within a node.js CLI installing the repositories mentioned above.
